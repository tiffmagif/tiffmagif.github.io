        <h2>Weather</h2>

        <h2>Traffic</h2>
        <p>According to a new TomTom Traffic Index report based on 2014 data, Seattle tied for number 4 with News York City as having the worst traffic congestion in the United States. Only Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu ranked higher. With the constant influx of new residents to Seattle to take jobs at Amazon and other tech companies, it's looking a little grim out there traffic-wise. Alternatively, several cities in Texas, including Lubbock, El Paso, and Austin were listed as some of the Top Cities to be a Driver by WalletHub in 2015.

        <h2>Real Estate</h2>
        <p>Homebuyers in the Puget Sound area are facing a shortage of options and skyrocketing prices in a tight housing market. Homes for sale typically experience packed open houses and multiple offers well above the asking prices. January's inventory in King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties was down by 31%.
